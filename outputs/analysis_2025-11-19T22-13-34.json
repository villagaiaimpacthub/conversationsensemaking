Because if anybody on this call says that I know exactly all the steps that we need to walk in the next six months or next one year or whatever it is, that's not true because nobody does. But we only know something, and that something is that we have a very strong connection of why we started this. And we know that we will face challenges and uncertainties, and we have to figure it out, including how to work together and how we align internally.",

      "text": "I think as long as we have transparent, safe space and ability to understand why we're here all together, conflicts of interest shouldn't scare us at all. They are all solvable, as long as we can just communicate. But I wanted to maybe highlight something else more. It's not just expectations on the possible outcomes and pathways, how it can be done, should be done, how to rely on all of those things and so on. It's more of the complexity itself, so many multi-faceted pieces. won't include完全 LL, to everything do So I'm think I Bearing, don't most of It's coming together. It's like collective cubic, cubic, which we are putting together. So I think it's like for just our well-being, in a way, it would be nice to maybe have a recall that it is a humongous endeavor which will require our collective competence, excellence, and sensitivity to see through step by step. And a lot of things even, like, probably planned for the literally next hundred days might be overkill and need to be scaled down to be, like, way more realistic. So that not just we are capable of doing this, but also that we not feel overloaded every time we look into any plans and milestones and trying to assess things we can't possibly assess at the moment. And to be okay with that, as in, like, move slow. But in a more cohesive and calm way, achieving more, actually, while moving slower, but really having enough time and space for us to have transparent, heart-to-heart communications at all times, recognizing that we all have our personal, business, collective interests, and sometimes they will come in conflict, and that is just okay.",
