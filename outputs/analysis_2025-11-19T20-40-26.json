So, for now, I'm just walking through some of the things that the Anchor Circle has been looking at. So, week one, straight up. We came back from Tuscany in the first meeting that we had. The vision, mission, and the creed that Shyamana just beautifully read out were kind of formally adopted as the underlying basis for Better World. The core values also were finalized. Since we still are to put in place a more robust governance framework, for now we agreed to essentially follow holacracy principles to be adopted as an interim governance framework. Based on that, I think there was a brief discussion on this even at the gathering as well. A provisional anchor circle was formed, and I want to highlight the word provisional. This basically is just taking some of the founders or the legal directors of some of the entities within the MBS who came part of the anchor circle. The idea is within the next six months, once we have the new governance charter adopted, we will put in place a new sociocratic election process. Just for now, the intention of this is to get the ball rolling. Base is the provisional anchor circle.",

Because if anybody on this call says that I know exactly all the steps that we need to walk in the next six months or next one year or whatever it is, that's not true because nobody does. But we only know something, and that something is that we have a very strong connection of why we started this.

We have a pretty extensive, talented, unique group of people who their intent is to move this forward, and I've spoken with most of you individually. And, you know, I ask them a lot of simple questions like what's your whistlish and what you kind of want to see out of this. So I think that's really important for everybody to identify and feel that they understand what their abilities are and what their, you know, time constraints may be and what some of those needs are. Because I think as a collective group, we always got to be in care of each other. So I think it's important to have some semblance of what that means for you and be able to communicate that. And I think, you know, obviously, I think Natalie's done a great job of, you know, beginning the well-being.

See what they can get from this. It's super important. And know that we will always, for sure, take care of each other in the way that makes sense. But see in whatever capacity you can to kind of drop that thing of, this is mine, this is me, this is what I should be doing for myself, and making it more about, this is what I want to do first. And then through that, work out a way for what I can get from this. That'll actually make things a lot better, because that's where I also see a bit of friction, to be honest.

Then what does it conflict in terms of operational efficiency from the next weeks? Okay. So, and that's another perspective. How much does it cost? Because I know that the Villa Gaia team is so generous that they will make this basically even for one year without asking a single dollar for their work. So, has been the budget for this work for the first year decided before we put on the table any intensive work that probably is going to affect usually the initial part of the fundraising? That's my thinking, you know, and I'm thinking aloud. There was nothing prepared before this. I'm just sharing, how do I see from the entrepreneurial perspective, are we validating the model or what, or are we just testing and failing by, you know? the approach that you are bringing in the holacracy system. So, yeah, those are my thoughts. I don't know how the holacracy works with respect of alternative proposals that are being collected out of the inner circle. If the inner circle accept without even noticing out what is the decision being taken, I maybe need to have some clarification on the holacracy principle. Because any decision should be made in the best interest of the group, okay? Not only because it's supported by the inner circle itself. Yeah, still, my doubt is how we're going to be sustainable with all the decisions that we're going to make from now on. And I hope this is perceived as a really, you know, proactive and really positive message, because I want this to be sustainable. possible. That's it. So, holocracy and planning and investing maybe are the three key points that should be, I don't know, discussed further. And I am a bit in the dark now because I don't know how to approach either in my usual way of managing things. So, maybe I'm also asking the help for this in this moment.",

      "text": "So, I realized that actually, governance, and it was my attempt, and I'm talking frankly here, and maybe I want to bring up the point that was supposed to be after the questions, Natalie, I think because it's important that I plug it in here. So, the, as you all know, that the foundation was represented in the anchor circle, not as a foundation, okay, not as an entity, but as, Leading, and Anastasia leading, the communication and the governance circle. And really started with the governance circle, and then we went into the communication circle. And let's, you know, be just very, I'm being here very, very transparent, straightforward. Not even the people in the inner circle, or the anchor circle now, was called, or whatever is going to be called in the future, as Iris was giving me some feedback on the regenerative governance framework that I took on the liberty to start working on, that maybe we should call it the vitality circle or root circle. Even anchor, you know, even anchor, that idea that the anchor has a more authority over other circles. reality is that the anchor circle doesn't have any authority over other circles. it is systemic oversight, okay, but because the other circles are not there, you know, so like we are functioning with a, let's say, call it with a brain or with a heart, but then you don't have the other parts, so, and even within that, we still have to have our alignment. not all the anchor circle is aligned 100%, and, and, given the, uh, coming back to the foundation, um, after a few meetings, and, uh, we realized that, uh, in a discussion between Anastasia and myself, and you know that, I am on the board, uh, and still on the board of the foundation, uh, and, uh, that, the, uh, the, strategy or the integration strategy of the foundation into Better World. So, it would require that the whole foundation would be restructured, all of it, you know, from A to Z. And not only that, it also redefining its strategy. But this foundation already has boards and, you know, came with its own strategy and so on. So, it's not easy. So, we decided, okay, well, we will postpone or delay that integration. And therefore, Anastasia decided that it's not the right time to put her energy and time into this. Or launching. Or The, the. ecosystem, you know, we will figure it out later. And that's, that's perfectly okay. So we have these two things are still pending. We don't have actually lead yet for the governance circle and the communication circle. And my intent was in the next call for the anchor circle to nominate myself to lead the governance circle. And I was against being part of the governance circle. All, all, along, but also realize that we need the baseline and I can bring the baseline, some practical guy. And I was maybe waiting for something to emerge, but I haven't seen it. So my answer to you is straightforward, Manuel. There is a representative link, which means there are two people from the circles. you, you, to to I'm We'll be bringing the feedback from the circles into the anchor circle. And these two people will be sitting on the anchor circle to represent the collective. So we don't need to go into, okay, what is the pulse here? Okay, so, and then the lead link or the, which is now Sudhir is acting as the lead link, bringing the strategy from the anchor circle into the other circle. So you have a two-way communication that is happening, okay? But, like, from the other circles into the anchor circle, and then you have the way down. We don't have that yet, okay? So, to say the least, that the anchor circle, even in its own roles and structure, is not complete yet. And, and, and, and. The other part is that, as I said, and you know this perfectly, when you are holding or running an entrepreneurial activity, you are, you know, between Brack is the founder, and you go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. We can't do this here. I can't do this here. I can, of course, you know, but I don't want to, you know. I don't want to, and that's not right, and nobody should, because this is about distributing power, and we need to walk the talk. It's going to take us less time. We're going to be more confused. We're going to create more tension. We're going to say, , man, I used to do things. It's very physical. Of course, if I'm making the whole decisions, and or you or anybody, you can do this in no time. But it's part of the learning that we need to go through it, and I really appreciate you coming forward and putting it here. I don't Provide more these opinions and decisions because we want to move ahead. And maybe, who knows, but as we move on, maybe we will lean into becoming, you know, for the next six months, making decisions, not sitting within somebody's authority, but so that we can get things running until we steward it to the time where we can say, now it's ready for election, hey guys, you can elect who's going to be on the anchor circle, who's going to be on the other circles, and so on. And that's exactly what it is here. The anchor circle has the roles, which will be nominated by others, will nominate who's going to be there, and we will have an election, and with consent, we're working on that. I'm working personally on that, you know, and at the end, I think this will bring a lot more clarity into this. It's just a bit of time.",

      "text": "I'll it very short, yeah. On the compensation part, right? I mean, the thing is, like I said before as well, when I first came and saw how things were working so far, to be honest, I was quite uncomfortable. didn't make sense for me at all, right, in the way things were so far, because, and this is, again, my personal views of this, nothing has been discussed, where I would look at it in a very simple way, that time being spent has to be valued. How you value it, there can be multiple frameworks, whether it's for a role, whether it's for the person, where they are, and so on and so forth, needs to be valued. And there needs to be some framework in place for that, independent of what each one's choices and what they want to take or not to take. Once you value it, then the next thing would be, of course, if someone is... Absolutely align with the cause so much, they don't need the money. mean, the thing is that there should be pathways for financial abundance for all. That's the fundamental thing, including us through this. And we need to work out what those pathways are, number one. And number two, after that, there are two things that can be variables. One variable can be what are the resources that we have currently that we can afford? How much can we, from a practical standpoint, defer it out? Because this is the only thing that we can do to get the ball rolling. And how much can we upfront? And we need to work out modalities for that, to fit it within the cash flow budget, so to say, to get the ball rolling and have a model that can be self-sustaining, like you said, Manit. And then the other thing would be is, after iterating for what is upfront and what is deferred basis, the resources available, individuals themselves can choose whether they want that or not. If they feel that they align with the cause so much, then they'd rather pull it back for the collective purpose. Beautiful, right? Nothing like it, right? But at the same time, attribution should be there, the first step. One can choose to say, I don't I this money because I'm very abundant within. I just sit in a cave and meditate, so I don't need the money. So I'm just happy to basically put it for a collective purpose, so to say, whatever that might be. So I think we just need to work with that framework ASAP. And then also for the past work that has been done, figure out some framework to kind of take care of that.",

      "text": "I wanted to make a quick callback to a few thoughts shared by Chris and Sadir and Alex and Mano and you. I think as long as we have transparent, safe space and ability to understand why we're here all together, conflicts of interest shouldn't scare us at all. They are all solvable, as long as we can just communicate. But I wanted to maybe highlight something else more. It's not just expectations on the possible outcomes and pathways, how it can be done, should be done, how to rely on all of those things and so on. It's more of the complexity itself, so many multi-faceted pieces. won't include完全 LL, to everything do So I'm think I Bearing, don't most of It's coming together. It's like collective cubic, cubic, which we are putting together. So I think it's like for just our well-being, in a way, it would be nice to maybe have a recall that it is a humongous endeavor which will require our collective competence, excellence, and sensitivity to see through step by step. And a lot of things even, like, probably planned for the literally next hundred days might be overkill and need to be scaled down to be, like, way more realistic. So that not just we are capable of doing this, but also that we not feel overloaded every time we look into any plans and milestones and trying to assess things we can't possibly assess at the moment. And to be okay with that, as in, like, move slow. But in a more cohesive and calm way, achieving more, actually, while moving slower, but really having enough time and space for us to have transparent, heart-to-heart communications at all times, recognizing that we all have our personal, business, collective interests, and sometimes they will come in conflict, and that is just okay.",
