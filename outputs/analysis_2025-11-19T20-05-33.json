And, you know, but I don't think, you know, we should maybe have a target to try to get some preliminary circles and just move things forward, right? I mean, it's, it's all work in progress, right? So it doesn't have to be perfect today. And it may not be perfect today. It's okay. That's just my suggestion. Okay. I agree with that, Alex. I think we need to start the circles now. I don't think we should delay this anymore with everybody involved and knowing what and how they can contribute towards the building of it. Okay, great. So let's do that. And it would be a good point to have a chapter, you know, just like. I mean, I shared here the charter for the NSOPA and, you know, putting some KPIs and stuff. Even though, I mean, this is like, mean, it's a preliminary, but then it helps giving some container with guidance to the people and say, okay, we know that we have an integration steward. His name is Sudhir. So Sudhir is responsible, you know, to connect everybody. That's it. I mean, so it's a role and somebody's playing it or metrics and that's G, you know, so we don't need to kind of a, so I can share individually if you like some of these charter. I mean, as a framework, not necessarily as a, you know, as a content per se. So everyone, every circle. We decide on these keeping the eyes and changing the roles or whatever, but we'll be just a guide. So I could share it just to, you know, in that sense, consider me your assistant here to help putting the frame and get this going faster.

And as the universe gives us, I had a conversation with Anastasia, Restate is philanthropic, has the ability to take philanthropic givings. And I think Anastasia is going to confirm, but we're pretty confident that the charter she has is symbiotic to the U.S. And the reason why I think this is really important, as we're working through our financial structure and taking in investment dollars, that is going to take some time. There's no question, right? That has to be done right. But philanthropic giving is not a hard lift. And if people believe in our ideas and believe in our thought process and want to support us, I think it's a great way to maybe get in some of those much-needed dollars, especially as it relates to Villagaya, as it relates. And it could even be in service in kind, like if we need really good attorneys and things like that, people at this point, you know, especially as we come to the end of the tax year, could really donate some of those services and also make them feel part of something bigger. You know, a great way of being connected to something is to give something, right? So, and I think we probably all within our entire ecosystem know a lot of corporations and a lot of people that did really well this year and probably need a tax write-off. So it's not all truistic, but they would love and welcome some form of tax write-off. And it might be a very fast path for us to bring in some dollars to execute on some of the agenda items we want to do. So, I know Anastasia, I think she's going to speak to Deloitte. I think that's who does her auditing for her, just to confirm 100%. But I believe that that charter enables not only Swiss law, but U.S.",
