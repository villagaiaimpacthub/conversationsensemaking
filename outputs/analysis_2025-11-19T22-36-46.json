Because if anybody on this call says that I know exactly all the steps that we need to walk in the next six months or next one year or whatever it is, that's not true because nobody does. But we only know something, and that something is that we have a very strong connection of why we started this. And we know that we will face challenges and uncertainties, and we have to figure it out, including how to work together and how we align internally.",

We have a pretty extensive, talented, unique group of people who their intent is to move this forward, and I've spoken with most of you individually. And, you know, I ask them a lot of simple questions like what's your whistlish and what you kind of want to see out of this. So I think that's really important for everybody to identify and feel that they understand what their abilities are and what their, you know, time constraints may be and what some of those needs are. Because I think as a collective group, we always got to be in care of each other. So I think it's important to have some semblance of what that means for you and be able to communicate that.",

And to be okay with that, as in, like, move slow. But in a more cohesive and calm way, achieving more, actually, while moving slower, but really having enough time and space for us to have transparent, heart-to-heart communications at all times, recognizing that we all have our personal, business, collective interests, and sometimes they will come in conflict, and that is just okay.",
