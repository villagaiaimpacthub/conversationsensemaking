And, you know, I ask them a lot of simple questions like what's your whistlish and what you kind of want to see out of this. So I think that's really important for everybody to identify and feel that they understand what their abilities are and what their, you know, time constraints may be and what some of those needs are. Because I think as a collective group, we always got to be in care of each other.",

And a lot of things even, like, probably planned for the literally next hundred days might be overkill and need to be scaled down to be, like, way more realistic. So that not just we are capable of doing this, but also that we not feel overloaded every time we look into any plans and milestones and trying to assess things we can't possibly assess at the moment. And to be okay with that, as in, like, move slow. But in a more cohesive and calm way, achieving more, actually, while moving slower, but really having enough time and space for us to have transparent, heart-to-heart communications at all times, recognizing that we all have our personal, business, collective interests, and sometimes they will come in conflict, and that is just okay.",
