So, the tension to bring these parts together, which they were already operating with their own And if trying to bring them together, this is where I would say the tire hit the road, and we can talk about collaboration in theory for days and years, but what we are doing is collaboration in action. And it takes courage, it takes love, it takes reminding us what is this all about, why we came together. It's not easy. I mean, every one of us is in a different country, different place. So, just putting a seed there, that whatever has been shared... is a work in progress. there's a huge uncertainty. and especially at the beginning. and we have two choices to play with uncertainty. either we celebrate it with knowing that there is magic will unfold at some point of time and have the courage to walk through that uncertainty or we can embrace it with with concern and this is a choice that we make personally and we can make this choice but also we can make the other choice and this is for me here an invitation to embrace uncertainty and and for us collectively and I the responsibility for a better communication, starting with myself, and a clear communication. Because if anybody on this call says that I know exactly all the steps that we need to walk in the next six months or next one year or whatever it is, that's not true because nobody does. But we only know something, and that something is that we have a very strong connection of why we started this. And we know that we will face challenges and uncertainties, and we have to figure it out, including how to work together and how we align internally. It's especially when you try to distribute power. It's easy when... In a startup, they launch a company, and one guy is named a founder, and then you keep running, and then you get this guy and the other guy, and so on, you know, that's easy. Some of you here are entrepreneurs, they've done that. That's actually easy. This is difficult. So, embracing this with an open heart, and this message for me first, and for you second.

So that's the part where, I mean, we've not gotten a head around it the way I see it. mean, Alex, can, of course, add Natalie, all of you guys, but I mean, the minute we can just align that, like, for example, on the legal side within operations, I was able to at least identify the next 100-day requirements. What has to be done? And straight away, I could at least loop Iris in, so that at least she starts to look in a very, very concrete way, right?

We have a pretty extensive, talented, unique group of people who their intent is to move this forward, and I've spoken with most of you individually. And, you know, I ask them a lot of simple questions like what's your whistlish and what you kind of want to see out of this. So I think that's really important for everybody to identify and feel that they understand what their abilities are and what their, you know, time constraints may be and what some of those needs are. Because I think as a collective group, we always got to be in care of each other. So I think it's important to have some semblance of what that means for you and be able to communicate that. And I think, you know, obviously, I think Natalie's done a great job of, you know, beginning the well-being. And I think that's probably a good place to maybe start if you have some of those concerns or thoughts or ideas just to communicate it so we have a baseline. The second part, now that we have the platform up. part, up, up, we up, platform platform up, we have It would be my recommendation that our anchor group, that we post that information to the collective group after every meeting, and maybe even have some short-term initiatives that are done for every group, that the collective group can look in and say, wait, you know, I know this person, or I may be able to add value there. Just open up that ability to the collective group to help, and to Charles' point, is to share some of that workload. And it makes sense that within the circles, you know, you're going to have some, you know, obviously you need to have some form of leader direction, but I think once everyone understands maybe and can physically see some of the challenges of each group, I know as a collective group, I know everyone's going to be willing to help or be able to figure out at least one kernel of how to lift or add something to it. So I'm excited. you. I that standpoint that we have the platform up, because I think that is going to help us communicate. You know, we talk about the mycelium network, so I think that is one way of keeping us connected. So they're just my suggestions. And I think in doing that, communication begins to flow. I think that's probably the most powerful thing that we have, is that we're all pretty open to each other. So I just want to, you know, state that and make sure that we all feel safe in that, and we continue to do that. Good, bad, or indifferent. You know, as a family, you always got to, you got to talk about everything, right? And so I think that's just an important part, an important point that I wanted to make. I feel safe in doing that, so, and I want to just thank, you know, the people who make me feel that way. So, and it's a good feeling. So, yeah, I just wanted to share those ideas.",

I'm still seeing a bit of that. I would, I mean, request that the approach should be, what can I give to this first, right? And approach it from the standpoint of what can I give for Better World? Because it's all still new. all, I mean, there wasn't anything called Better World till some time back, right? So unless we can put the interests of the collective first before each one prime.

Or launching. Or The, the. ecosystem, you know, we will figure it out later. And that's, that's perfectly okay. So we have these two things are still pending. We don't have actually lead yet for the governance circle and the communication circle. And my intent was in the next call for the anchor circle to nominate myself to lead the governance circle. And I was against being part of the governance circle. All, all, along, but also realize that we need the baseline and I can bring the baseline, some practical guy. And I was maybe waiting for something to emerge, but I haven't seen it. So my answer to you is straightforward, Manuel. There is a representative link, which means there are two people from the circles. you, you, to to I'm We'll be bringing the feedback from the circles into the anchor circle. And these two people will be sitting on the anchor circle to represent the collective. So we don't need to go into, okay, what is the pulse here? Okay, so, and then the lead link or the, which is now Sudhir is acting as the lead link, bringing the strategy from the anchor circle into the other circle. So you have a two-way communication that is happening, okay? But, like, from the other circles into the anchor circle, and then you have the way down. We don't have that yet, okay? So, to say the least, that the anchor circle, even in its own roles and structure, is not complete yet. And, and, and, and. The other part is that, as I said, and you know this perfectly, when you are holding or running an entrepreneurial activity, you are, you know, between Brack is the founder, and you go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. We can't do this here. I can't do this here. I can, of course, you know, but I don't want to, you know. I don't want to, and that's not right, and nobody should, because this is about distributing power, and we need to walk the talk. It's going to take us less time. We're going to be more confused. We're going to create more tension. We're going to say, , man, I used to do things. It's very physical. Of course, if I'm making the whole decisions, and or you or anybody, you can do this in no time. But it's part of the learning that we need to go through it, and I really appreciate you coming forward and putting it here. I don't Provide more these opinions and decisions because we want to move ahead. And maybe, who knows, but as we move on, maybe we will lean into becoming, you know, for the next six months, making decisions, not sitting within somebody's authority, but so that we can get things running until we steward it to the time where we can say, now it's ready for election, hey guys, you can elect who's going to be on the anchor circle, who's going to be on the other circles, and so on. And that's exactly what it is here. The anchor circle has the roles, which will be nominated by others, will nominate who's going to be there, and we will have an election, and with consent, we're working on that.

I mean, the thing is, like I said before as well, when I first came and saw how things were working so far, to be honest, I was quite uncomfortable. didn't make sense for me at all, right, in the way things were so far, because, and this is, again, my personal views of this, nothing has been discussed, where I would look at it in a very simple way, that time being spent has to be valued. How you value it, there can be multiple frameworks, whether it's for a role, whether it's for the person, where they are, and so on and so forth, needs to be valued. And there needs to be some framework in place for that, independent of what each one's choices and what they want to take or not to take. Once you value it, then the next thing would be, of course, if someone is... Absolutely align with the cause so much, they don't need the money. mean, the thing is that there should be pathways for financial abundance for all. That's the fundamental thing, including us through this. And we need to work out what those pathways are, number one. And number two, after that, there are two things that can be variables. One variable can be what are the resources that we have currently that we can afford? How much can we, from a practical standpoint, defer it out? Because this is the only thing that we can do to get the ball rolling. And how much can we upfront? And we need to work out modalities for that, to fit it within the cash flow budget, so to say, to get the ball rolling and have a model that can be self-sustaining, like you said, Manit. And then the other thing would be is, after iterating for what is upfront and what is deferred basis, the resources available, individuals themselves can choose whether they want that or not. If they feel that they align with the cause so much, then they'd rather pull it back for the collective purpose. Beautiful, right? Nothing like it, right? But at the same time, attribution should be there, the first step. One can choose to say, I don't I this money because I'm very abundant within. I just sit in a cave and meditate, so I don't need the money. So I'm just happy to basically put it for a collective purpose, so to say, whatever that might be.

And it seems, for example, the decision that Manuela was pointing out, part of the rationale was, let's not use an extractive product. Let's use something that's more regenerative. I really think understanding what... Regenerative is having a common understanding of what it is and what it isn't, understanding that we are not going to be regenerative on day one, and we need to go through horizon two transformation, and that we are making decisions sometimes which are horizon two minus, sometimes horizon two plus, and that those decisions can be made explicitly and intentionally.

I think as long as we have transparent, safe space and ability to understand why we're here all together, conflicts of interest shouldn't scare us at all. They are all solvable, as long as we can just communicate. But I wanted to maybe highlight something else more. It's not just expectations on the possible outcomes and pathways, how it can be done, should be done, how to rely on all of those things and so on. It's more of the complexity itself, so many multi-faceted pieces. won't include完全 LL, to everything do So I'm think I Bearing, don't most of It's coming together. It's like collective cubic, cubic, which we are putting together. So I think it's like for just our well-being, in a way, it would be nice to maybe have a recall that it is a humongous endeavor which will require our collective competence, excellence, and sensitivity to see through step by step. And a lot of things even, like, probably planned for the literally next hundred days might be overkill and need to be scaled down to be, like, way more realistic. So that not just we are capable of doing this, but also that we not feel overloaded every time we look into any plans and milestones and trying to assess things we can't possibly assess at the moment. And to be okay with that, as in, like, move slow. But in a more cohesive and calm way, achieving more, actually, while moving slower, but really having enough time and space for us to have transparent, heart-to-heart communications at all times, recognizing that we all have our personal, business, collective interests, and sometimes they will come in conflict, and that is just okay.",
